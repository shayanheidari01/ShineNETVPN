## 2. Limited Technical Data We Collect

To provide optimal service quality and server recommendations, we collect minimal, **anonymized technical data**:

### 2.1 Anonymous Analytics
- 📊 **Anonymized IP Region** (first 3 octets only, e.g., 192.168.1.xxx becomes 192.168.1.***)
- 🌍 **General Geographic Region** (country/timezone for server optimization)
- 📱 **Device Information**: Android version, app version
- 🔄 **Connection Status**: Connected/disconnected state, ping times
- 📈 **Server Performance**: Aggregated server health metrics

### 2.2 Purpose of Data Collection
This limited data helps us:

- ✅ Maintain healthy and functional server configurations
- ✅ Optimize server selection based on your region
- ✅ Improve app performance and stability
- ✅ Detect and resolve connectivity issues

### 2.3 Server IP Geolocation (for accurate location labels)
- 🌐 We may query free IP geolocation services to resolve the approximate location of VPN servers only (not your IP).
- 🎯 We only query when we have a real IP address for a server. If the configuration uses a domain name, we skip external lookup.
- 🧭 Data requested: server IP → country, region, city (to display flag and location next to the server name).
- 🔁 Caching: results are cached locally for 24–48 hours to reduce network calls; no personal identifiers are stored.
- ⏱️ Timeouts: requests have strict 5s connect/receive timeouts and a simple User-Agent (e.g., "ShineNETVPN/1.0").
- 🚫 No personal data is sent. Only the server IP is used for lookup.

### 2.4 Version Update Check
- 📦 On startup, the app may fetch a tiny JSON file from GitHub to check the latest version and a download link.
- 🔒 We do not send any personal data. The app version comparison happens locally on your device.
- 🔔 If a mandatory update is required, the app shows a non-dismissible dialog with a link to the latest release.

### 2.5 Latency (Ping) Measurements
- 📶 The app measures latency to available VPN servers to recommend better-performing options.
- 🧪 Only the target servers are tested; no user content is inspected or analyzed.
- 🗃️ Results are stored locally and may be cached for 5–10 minutes to improve responsiveness.
- 🔐 These measurements are used solely to rank servers; they are not linked to personal identities.
